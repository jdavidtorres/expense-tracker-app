# Migration from Blazor Hybrid to Pure .NET MAUI

This document outlines the migration process from a .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid application to a pure .NET MAUI application with native XAML UI and MVVM architecture.

## Overview

The migration involved converting the application from using Blazor components hosted in a `BlazorWebView` to native MAUI XAML pages with ViewModels, following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Project Configuration Changes

**Before:**
- Used `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebView.Maui` package
- Targeted .NET 8.0
- Used Blazor components for UI

**After:**
- Removed Blazor dependencies
- Upgraded to .NET 9.0
- Added `CommunityToolkit.Mvvm` for MVVM support
- Updated MAUI packages to version 9.0.10

### 2. Architecture Changes

#### Removed Blazor Components
- Deleted `Components/` folder containing:
  - `App.razor`
  - `Pages/Dashboard.razor`
  - `Pages/Subscriptions.razor` 
  - `Pages/Invoices.razor`
  - `Layout/MainLayout.razor`
  - `Forms/` components
- Removed `wwwroot/` folder with CSS and JavaScript files

#### Added MAUI XAML Pages
- `Views/DashboardPage.xaml` - Native dashboard with summary cards and lists
- `Views/SubscriptionsPage.xaml` - Native subscriptions list view
- `Views/InvoicesPage.xaml` - Native invoices list view
- `AppShell.xaml` - Shell-based navigation with tab bar

#### Implemented MVVM Architecture
- `ViewModels/BaseViewModel.cs` - Base class with common functionality
- `ViewModels/DashboardViewModel.cs` - Dashboard logic with data loading
- `ViewModels/SubscriptionsViewModel.cs` - Subscriptions management
- `ViewModels/InvoicesViewModel.cs` - Invoices management

### 3. Navigation Changes

**Before:**
- Used Blazor Router for navigation
- Components were loaded in BlazorWebView

**After:**
- Shell-based navigation with TabBar
- Native MAUI navigation commands
- Route-based navigation with `Shell.Current.GoToAsync()`

### 4. Data Binding Changes

**Before:**
```razor
@inject ExpenseService ExpenseService
@if (loading) { ... }
```

**After:**
```xml
<ActivityIndicator IsVisible="{Binding IsBusy}" IsRunning="{Binding IsBusy}" />
```

### 5. Dependency Injection Updates

**MauiProgram.cs** now registers:
- Pages as transient services
- ViewModels as transient services
- HttpClient for ExpenseService
- Removed Blazor-specific services

## Building the Application

### Prerequisites

To build the MAUI application, you need to install the .NET MAUI workloads:

```bash
# Install MAUI workloads
dotnet workload install maui

# Restore workloads for the project
dotnet workload restore
```

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build for Android
dotnet build -f net9.0-android

# Build for iOS
dotnet build -f net9.0-ios

# Build for Windows
dotnet build -f net9.0-windows

# Build for macOS
dotnet build -f net9.0-maccatalyst
```

### Development

```bash
# Run on Android emulator
dotnet run --project ExpenseTracker.Maui -f net9.0-android

# Run on Windows
dotnet run --project ExpenseTracker.Maui -f net9.0-windows
```

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. Performance
- Native MAUI controls instead of web-based Blazor components
- Direct data binding without web view overhead
- Platform-specific optimizations

### 2. Platform Integration
- Better access to native platform APIs
- Improved gesture handling and animations
- Platform-specific UI adaptations

### 3. Development Experience
- Hot reload support for XAML
- Better debugging experience
- Native design tools support

### 4. Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns with MVVM
- Testable ViewModels
- Reusable components

## Preserved Functionality

The following components were preserved without changes:

### ExpenseTracker.Shared Project
- `Models/` - All data models (Expense, Subscription, Invoice, Summary)
- `Services/ExpenseService.cs` - HTTP client for API communication
- Business logic and data contracts remain unchanged

### API Integration
- Same HTTP client configuration
- Identical API endpoints and data flow
- Preserved error handling patterns

## UI Features Implemented

### Dashboard Page
- Monthly summary cards showing subscriptions, invoices, and total expenses
- Recent subscriptions and invoices lists
- Navigation to detailed views
- Refresh functionality

### Subscriptions Page
- List of all subscriptions with amount and billing cycle
- Loading states and error handling
- Pull-to-refresh capability

### Invoices Page
- List of invoices with due dates and payment status
- Visual indicators for invoice status
- Loading and error states

### Shell Navigation
- Tab-based navigation between main pages
- Icon support for navigation items
- Route-based deep linking capability

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Add unit tests for ViewModels
2. **Enhanced UI**: Implement platform-specific styling
3. **Additional Features**: Add CRUD operations for subscriptions/invoices
4. **Performance**: Implement data virtualization for large lists
5. **Accessibility**: Add accessibility labels and behaviors

## Migration Verification

To verify the migration was successful:

1. Build the project without errors
2. Confirm no Blazor dependencies remain
3. Verify MVVM pattern implementation
4. Test navigation between pages
5. Confirm data loading from API works correctly

The migration maintains all existing functionality while providing a more native, performant, and maintainable application architecture.
